The goal of pmev is to implement project management tracking metrics as outlined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) manual which can be found \href{https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok}{here}.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `pmev` using either:

``` r
# install.packages("pmev")
# Or the development version at
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("david-hammond/pmev")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(pmev)
data(project)
earnedvalue <- ev$new(start = project$start,
                       end = project$end,
                       progress = project$progress,
                       planned_cost = project$planned_cost,
                       project_value = 150000,
                       cost_to_date = 10000,
                       date = "2024-07-03")
print(earnedvalue$earned_value)
```


The Earned Value can then be plotted in the following way.

```{r, message = FALSE}
plot(earnedvalue)
```
